description: Partytown - Run third-party scripts from a web worker
---

Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), and off of the [main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread). Its goal is to help speed up sites by dedicating the main thread to your code, and offloading third-party scripts to a web worker.

## Goals

We set out to solve this situation, so that apps of all sizes will be able to continue to use third-party scripts without the performance hit. Some of Partytown's goals include:

- Free up main thread resources to be used only for the primary web app execution.
- Sandbox third-party scripts and allow or deny their access main thread APIs.
- Isolate long-running tasks within the web worker thread.
- Reduce layout thrashing coming from third-party scripts by batching DOM setters/getter into group updates.
- Throttle third-party scripts' access to the main thread.
- Allow third-party scripts to run exactly how they're coded and without any alterations.
- Read and write main thread DOM operations _synchronously_ from within a web worker, allowing scripts running from the web worker to execute as expected.

## Web Workers

Partytown's philosophy is that the main thread should be dedicated to your code, and any scripts that are not required to be in the [critical path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path) should be moved to a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API). Main thread performance is, without question, more important than web worker thread performance. Please see the [test pages](/tests/) for some live demos.

## Use-Cases

While full webapps "can" run from within Partytown, it's actually best intended for code that doesn't need to be in the [critical rendering path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path). Most third-party scripts fall into this category, as they're not required for the first-paint. Additionally, the asynchronous natural of most third-party script works well with Partytown, as they can lazily receive user events and post data to their respective services.

Below are just a few examples of third-party scripts that might be a good candidate to run from within a web worker. The goal is to continue validating commonly used services to ensure Partytown has the correct API, but Partytown itself does not hardcode to any specific services.
