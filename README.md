> A fun location for your third-party scripts to hang out

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! This is experimental! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), and off of the [main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread). Its goal is to help speed up sites by dedicating the main thread to your code, and offloading third-party scripts to a web worker.

### Negative Impacts From Third-Party Scripts

Even with a fast and highly tuned site following all of today's best practices, it's all too common for your performance wins to be erased the moment third-party scripts are added. By third-party scripts we mean code that is embedded within your site, but not directly under your control. A few examples include: analytics, metrics, ads, A/B testing, trackers, etc. Their inclusion are often a double-edged sword.

Below is a summary of potential issues, referenced from [Loading Third-Party JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript):

- Firing too many network requests to multiple servers. The more requests a site has to make, the longer it can take to load.
- Sending too much JavaScript which keeps the main thread busy. Too much JavaScript can block DOM construction, delaying how quickly pages can render.
- CPU-intensive script parsing and execution can delay user interaction and cause battery drain.
- Third-party scripts that were loaded without care can be a single-point of failure (SPOF).
- Insufficient HTTP caching, forcing resources to be fetched from the network often.
- The use of legacy APIs (e.g `document.write()`), which are known to be harmful to the user experience.
- Excessive DOM elements or expensive CSS selectors.
- Including multiple third-party embeds that can lead to multiple frameworks and libraries being pulled in several times, which exacerbates the performance issues.
- Third-party scripts also often use embed techniques that can block `window.onload`, even if the embed is using async or defer.

### Goals

We set out to solve this situation, so that apps of all sizes will be able to continue to use third-party scripts without the performance hit. Some of Partytown's goals include:

- Free up main thread resources to be used only for the primary web app execution.
- Sandbox third-party scripts and allow or deny their access main thread APIs.
- Isolate long-running tasks within the web worker thread.
- Reduce layout thrashing coming from third-party scripts.
- Throttle third-party scripts' access to the main thread.
- Allow third-party scripts to run exactly how they're coded and without any alterations.
- Read and write main thread DOM operations _synchronously_ from within a web worker, allowing scripts running from the web worker to execute as expected.
- No build-steps or bundling required, but rather update scripts the same way as traditional third-party scripts are updated.

## Web Workers

Partytown's philosophy is that the main thread should be dedicated to your code, and any scripts that are not required to be in the [critical path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path) should be moved to a web worker. Main thread performance is, without question, more important than web worker thread performance. See the [example page](https://partytown.builder.io/example/) and [test pages](https://partytown.builder.io/) for some live demos.

> If you're looking to run _your_ app within a web worker, we recommend the [WorkerDom](https://github.com/ampproject/worker-dom) project.
